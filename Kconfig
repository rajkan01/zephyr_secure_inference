	  Enabling this option will make secure inference shell commands available.

	help
	  This string will be appended to the label used when deriving keys from
	  the HUK in the secure HUK service. It is used exclusively by TF-M, but
	  is exposed here for convenience purposes so that the Zephyr build
	  system can pass it through to TF-M.
